But they never step out of that small world, that ant-system, which they are in. It would never occur to them, for they don&#x27;t have the mentality to imagine anything of the kind. Thus the ants are very reliable components, in the sense that you can depend on them to perform certain kinds of tasks in certain ways. <br/> <it>Achilles:</it> But even so, within those limits they are still free, and they just act at random, running about incoherently without any regard for the thought mechanisms of a higher-level being which Dr. Anteater asserts they are merely components of.<br/><b>Douglas Hofstadter (in GEB)</b></pquote><pquote>Man suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for fun.<br/><br/><b>Alan Watts</b></pquote><pquote>The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

A person of good character looks within.</pquote><pquote style="text-align:left">In the domain of high energy physics, the curvature of spacetime is so small it hardly matters. Well at least this is what people thought for a long time. Till Maldacena came up with his Ads CFT correspondance. Maldacena showed that a computation in high energy physics which is QFT, which has nothing to do with gravity, can alternatively be derived from Einstein theory. Which means that, people who thought they would never need gravity to understand quantum field theory where completely taken aback because you can either do a very hard computation in QFT, can be captured by a very simple computation in Einstein&#x27;s theory. In fact an impossible question in the QFT side, can be done in one line on the gravity side. His version is called Ads / CFT correspondance, Ads is a very special gravity and CFT is a very special quantum field theory. But you can generalize it to guage theory and gravity correspondence. <br/><br/> So people who thought &#x27;okay we&#x27;ll never need einstein theory of gravity&#x27;, and then they where stuck at very difficult questions in quantum field thoery that they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to solve this thing. And out came this relationship where years and years where spent with no progress in QFT became a one line excersize on this side (puts mouse over ETh). So people who thought they would never need Einstein gravity had to go back and start learning GR, and you suddenly see in the ArXiv many of the people of QFT are now writing papers on GR, because they have now learned GR. So that you know that just because a subject is esoteric doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not useful.<br/><br/>According to the classical theory of radiation, if each Fourier mode of the equilibrium radiation (in an otherwise empty cavity with perfectly reflective walls) is considered as a degree of freedom capable of exchanging energy, then, according to the equipartition theorem of classical physics, there would be an equal amount of energy in each mode. Since there are an infinite number of modes, this would imply infinite heat capacity, as well as a nonphysical spectrum of emitted radiation that grows without bound with increasing frequency, a problem known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.<br/><br/><b>Keshav Dasgupta</b></pquote><pquote style="text-align:left">What I didn&#x27;t realize is that the structure of the Universities was that they were either hitting steady-state or growing very little or shrinking and that was a not a healthy place to be. Most of the good seats in the musical chairs competition had already been foudn in the 60s and they had occupants and we were in some sort of a game where we were doing work for the system but we weren&#x27;t set to inherit it. [...] Even though I wanted to do science rather than technology, it&#x27;s better to be in an expanding world and not quite in exactly the right field, than to be in a contracting world where people&#x27;s worst behavior comes out and your mind is grooved in defensive and rent-seeking types of ways. [...] If you take Hydra - they may come in a - these tiny microscopic animals - they come in a sexual variety and a sexless variety. It always seems to be that the thing that reproduces sexually senesces and gets old and dies. But sometimes the thing that doesn&#x27;t reproduce sexually seems to have some sort of immortality properties. So there&#x27;s some relationship between sex and death that we don&#x27;t quite understand. [...] Schrodinger (Erwin), didn&#x27;t really contribute into physics I think until his 40s and 50s, which was very late by the standards of the day. So sometimes you, at a personal level, you just have to get lucky in order to understand what it is that you&#x27;re supposed to be doing. [..] There was a news story that moved me and a lot of other people about a father who knew he was dying and came up with five years worth of birthday cards and flowers to send to the daughter, who then turned 21. She was sad that this was the last one she was getting. I thought, why is this a news story? Why aren’t we all doing this? Why only five years? And I read this story and I still didn’t do anything about it. So I think that, in some sense, if you guys want to lead the way and talk about how we play with death, rather than whistling past the graveyard, how we dance past it, and how we you know develop a more mature relationship, how we get excited about planning our wake, and thinking about the order of people we want to speak, and you know what we want to reveal years after we’re gone so that we can continue to have these conversations. [...] So just try to try to think about the fact that death is simply part of a program that is already immortal, which is the theory of lineage. Whether it’s the lineage of your ideas or the lineage of your genes, these things matter to all of us while we’re here and it’s one of the most exciting things to think about<br/><br/><b>Eric Weinstein</b></pquote><pquote style="text-align:left">Bohr has brought to my attention that the uncertainty in our observation does not arise exclusively from the occurrence of discontinuities, but is tied directly to the demand that we ascribe equal validity to the quite different experiments which show up in the particulate theory on one hand, and the wave theory on the other hand.<br/><br/><b>Heisenberg Paper, footnote</b><br/><br/>I like this quote because it reveals something about how physics was done back then.</pquote><pquote style="text-align:left"><b>We must learn to love. </b>This is our experience of music: we must first <i>learn to hear</i>, make out and distinguish a figure and a melody at all, to isolate and demarcate it as a living thing in its own right; then it requires a certain amount of effort and goodwill for us to tolerate it despite its strangeness; we need to exercise patience towards its aspect and expression, and generosity of spirit towards what is odd about it - finallythere comes a time when we are accustomed to it, have come to expect it, and we begin to suspect that we would miss it if it were gone; and now it continues to work its irresisteible magic on us more and more, and does not stop until we have become its abject and enraptured lovers, who want nothing more from the world than to experience it again and again.<br/><br/><b>Nietzsche (334)</b></pquote><pquote>In physics you get the best of both worlds.

And is it not natural to assume that the particular arragement of the planets with nearly circular orbits, all in the same plane and with the same direction of motion, shows the hand of the original designer?<br/><br/>**Salviati** Yes, that was Newton&#x27;s quest. And I believe he was deeply aware that every real event is something single and unique, which in a strict sense never happens again. Some of his followers may have forgotten that important point. It is the very essence of a physical law that it refers to reproducible physical situations and therefore, strictly speaking, never to an individual even, or rather to individual events only insofar as they are members of an ensemble of similar events.  <br/><br/><b>Jauch - Are Quanta Real - a Galilean Dialogue</b></pquote><pquote style="text-align:left">The nice thing about things that are urgent, is that if you wait long enough they aren&#x27;t urgent anymore.

Who we marry may depend on who happens to be around at the right time of life. On the other hand, the small decisions are very systematic. That I became a psychologist is probably not very revealing.

Too much sheltering from results can be stunting.

He didn&#x27;t work. And the cart of civilization, which he supposedly was being trained to pull, was just going to have to creak along a little slower without him. This is a tragedy, however, only if you presume that the cart of civilization, &quot;the system,&#x27;&#x27; is pulled by mules. This is a common, vocational, &quot;location&#x27;&#x27; point of view, but it&#x27;s not the Church attitude. The Church attitude is that civilization, or &quot;the system&#x27;&#x27; or &quot;society&#x27;&#x27; or whatever you want to call it, is best served not by mules but by free men. The purpose of abolishing grades and degrees is not to punish mules or to get rid of them but to provide an environment in which that mule can turn into a free man. The hypothetical student, still a mule, would drift around for a while. He would get another kind of education quite as valuable as the one he&#x27;d abandoned, in what used to be called the &quot;school of hard knocks.&#x27;&#x27; Instead of wasting money and time as a high-status mule, he would now have to get a job as a low-status mule, maybe as a mechanic. Actually his real status would go up. He would be making a contribution for a change. Maybe that&#x27;s what he would do for the rest of his life. Maybe he&#x27;d found his level. But don&#x27;t count on it. In time…six months; five years, perhaps…a change could easily begin to take place. He would become less and less satisfied with a kind of dumb, day-to-day shopwork. His creative intelligence, stifled by too much theory and too many grades in college, would now become reawakened by the boredom of the shop. Thousands of hours of frustrating mechanical problems would have made him more interested in machine design. He would like to design machinery himself. He&#x27;d think he could do a better job. He would try modifying a few engines, meet with success, look for more success, but feel blocked because he didn&#x27;t have the theoretical information. He would discover that when before he felt stupid because of his lack of interest in theoretical information, he&#x27;d now find a brand of theoretical information which he&#x27;d have a lot of respect for, namely, mechanical engineering.<br/><br/><b>Robert Piercig : Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintnance</b></pquote><pquote>No continuum in mathematics and therefore no continuum in physics. A half-century of development in the sphere of mathematical logic has made it clear that there is no evidence supporting the belief in the existential character of the number continuum. &quot;Belief in this transcendental world,&quot; Hermann Weyl tells us, &quot;taxes the strength of our faith hardly less than the doctrines of the early Fathers of the Church or of the scholastic philosophers of the Middle Ages&quot;. This lesson out of mathematics applies with equal strength to physics. &quot;Just as the introduction of the irrational numbers... is a convenient myth [which] simplifies the laws of arithmetic... so physical objects,&quot; William Van Orman Quine tells us &quot;are postulated entities which round out and simplify level answer.&quot;[...]<br/><br/><i>Fourth and last no</i>: No space, no time. Heaven did not hand down the word &quot;time&quot;. Man invented it, perhaps positing hopefully as he did that &quot;Time is Nature&#x27;s way to keep everything from happening all at once&quot;. If there are problems with the concept of time, they are of our own creation! As Leibniz tells us, &quot;... time and space are not things, but orders of things...;&quot; or as Einstein put it, &quot;Time and space are modes by which we think, and not conditions in which we live.&quot;<br/><br/>What are we to say about the weld of space and time into spacetime which Einstein gave us in his 1915 and still standard classical geometrodynamics? On this geometry quantum theory, we know, imposes fluctuations. Moreover, the predicted fluctuations grow so great at distances of the order of the Planck length that in that domain they put into question the connectivity of space and deprive the very concepts of &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; of all meaning. This circumstance reminds us anew that no account of existence can ever hope to rate as fundamental which does not translate all of continuum physics into the language of bits. We will not feed time into any deep-reaching account of existence. We must derive time - and time only in the continuum idealization - out of it. Likewise with space.[...] <br/><br/>Deplore? No, celebrate the absence of a clear definition of the term &quot;bit&quot; as elementary unit in the establishment of meaning. We reject &quot;that view of science which used to say, &#x27;Define your terms before you proceed.&#x27; The truly creative nature of any forward step in human knowledge,&quot; we know, &quot;is such that theory, concept, law and method of measurement - forever inseparable - are born into the world in union.&quot; If and when we learn how to combine bits in fantastically large numbers to obtain what we call existence, we will know better what we mean both by bit and by existence. <br/><br/>A single question animates this report: Can we ever expect to understand existence? Clues we have, and work to do, to make headway on the issue. Surely someday, we can believe, we will grasp the central idea of it all as so simple, so beautiful, so compelling that we will all say to each other, &quot;Oh, how could it have been otherwise!

They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one&#x27;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&#x27;s own way. <br/><br/> And there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of the typical inmate. [...] <br/><br/>Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him - mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. Dostoevski said once, &quot;There is only on thing that I drea: not to be worthy of my sufferings.&quot; These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whos suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost. It can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom - which cannot be taken away - that makes life meaningful and purposeful.[...] <br/><br/>We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life - daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the resposibility to find the right answers to its problems and to fulfil the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. <br/><br/>These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differe from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is imporssible to define the meaning of life in a general way.[...]<br/><br/>Sunday neurosis: that kind of depression which afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves becomes mansifest. [...] Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by *answering for* his own life;[...]<br/><br/>Categorical imperative of logotherapy : Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now![...] Self actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence. Thus far we have shown that the meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be. According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. [...] Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized.<br/><br/><b>Viktor Fankle : Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning</b></pquote><pquote>I love codeing but sometimes I just wanna shoot myself!<br/><br/><b>- Marley</b></pquote><pquote>I will arise and go now, for always night and day<br/><br/>I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;<br/><br/>While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,<br/><br/>I hear it in the deep heart&#x27;s core.<br/><br/><b>W.B.
