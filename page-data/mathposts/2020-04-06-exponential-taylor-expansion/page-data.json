I wanted to answer this question so I made this little gif, and the answer is surprisingly elegent: the dominant term of the taylor expansion is $$e^k:k\\in\\mathbb N$$ is $$k$$, and the distrubution looks pretty poissonian! You can certainly see a trend, where the standard deviation which I very crudly approximated looks like it's tending towards the square root of the number at which the series is being evaluated :).</p>\n<p>{% include image.html url=\"/assets/images/exponential_weight_dist.gif\" description=\"\" %}</p>\n<p>Denali says: This makes sense because if you fix $$x$$, then consider the ratio of the n plus one'th term and the n minus one'th term.</p>\n<p>$$\\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\\frac{n!}{x^n} = \\frac{x}{n+1}$$</p>\n<p>the $$n+1$$ th term onle becomes more important than the $$n$$th term when $$x > n+1$$</p>\n<p>You can find <a href=\"https://github.com/dcxSt/random-math/blob/master/exponential/exponential_weight_dist.gif\">the above gif here</a>, also if you'd like to see the <a href=\"https://github.com/dcxSt/random-math/blob/master/exponential/exponential%20terms%20animation%2C%20importance%20of%20terms%20in%20exponential%20transcendental%20function%20as%20x%20increases.ipynb\">source code</a> it's in the <a href=\"https://github.com/dcxSt/random-math/tree/master/exponential\">same file</a> in that repository.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Distribution of weight of each term in the exponential function.","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mathposts/2020-04-06-exponential-taylor-expansion/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
