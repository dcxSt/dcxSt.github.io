This constant appears in the coulomb attraction equaiton, for instance between point charges\n$$F = \\frac{q_1q_2}{4\\pi R^2 \\epsilon_0}$$</p>\n<h2>Fundamental Units</h2>\n<h3>Farad</h3>\n<p>An SI derived unit of capacitance - which is a ratio of how much voltage increase there is per colomb of charge added to a system. The units are $$C/V = C^2/J = \\frac{A^2s^4}{kg m^2}$$</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Physical Constants","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mathposts/2020-11-05-physical-constants/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
